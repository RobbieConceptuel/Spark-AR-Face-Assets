It has been widely used to create popular AR filters for Instagram, Facebook, and other social platforms.  
With its intuitive tools and strong community, Spark AR played a key role in the rise of augmentism, a trend that blends art and technology to enhance our perception of the world through digital experiences.

### The End of Spark AR Studio  
In January 2025, Meta Platforms Inc. decided to end the development and support of Spark AR Studio, marking the conclusion of a platform that significantly contributed to the growth of augmented reality in social media.
